# Optimisation
This is a code of my second article using GA entitled "Optimization of Injection Water Composition During Low Salinity Water Flooding in Carbonate Rocks: A numerical Simulation Study". This was a part of my master's thesis as well. It is worth to note that, in this code, we coupled Matlab with a Black oil simulator (Eclipse) and a geochemical software (PHREEQC).
